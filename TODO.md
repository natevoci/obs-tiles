# TODO list

- Configuration persistence
  - In localStorage?
  - By loading external config (eg. store in github)
- Warning message if using https instead of http
- Prevent screen sleeping
  - maybe with a looped video like suggested in https://stackoverflow.com/a/68301551
  - or maybe with https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js
